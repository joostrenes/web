  Abstract = {With over 10 million git repositories, GitHub is becoming one of
  the most important sources of software artifacts on the Internet. Researchers
  mine the information stored in GitHub's event logs to understand how its users
  employ the site to collaborate on software, but so far there have been no
  studies describing the quality and properties of the available GitHub data. We
  document the results of an empirical study aimed at understanding the
  characteristics of the repositories and users in GitHub; we see how users take
  advantage of GitHub's main features and how their activity is tracked on
  GitHub and related datasets to point out misalignment between the real and
  mined data. Our results indicate that while GitHub is a rich source of data on
  software development, mining GitHub for research purposes should take various
  potential perils into consideration. For example, we show that the majority of
  the projects are personal and inactive, and that almost 40\% of all pull
  requests do not appear as merged even though they were. Also, approximately
  half of GitHub's registered users do not have public activity, while the
  activity of GitHub users in repositories is not always easy to pinpoint. We
  use our identified perils to see if they can pose validity threats; we
  review selected papers from the MSR 2014 Mining Challenge and see if there are
  potential impacts to consider. We provide a set of recommendations for
  software engineering researchers on how to approach the data in GitHub.}

  abstract = {
    Software code review has been considered an important quality assurance
mechanism for the last 35 years. The techniques for conducting modern code reviews
have evolved along with the software industry and have become progressively
incremental and lightweight. We have studied code review in number of
contemporary settings, including Apache, Linux, KDE, Microsoft, Android, and
GitHub. Code review is an inherently social activity, so we have used both
quantitative and qualitative methods to understand the underlying parameters
(or measures) of the process, as well as the rich interactions and motivations
for doing code review. In this chapter, we describe how we have used a mixed
methods approach to triangulate our findings on code review. We also
describe how we use quantitative data to help us sample the most interesting
cases from our data to be analyzed qualitatively. To illustrate code review
research, we provide new results that contrast single and multi-commit reviews.
We find that while multi-commit reviews take longer and have more lines churned than
single commit reviews, the same number of people are involved in both types of
review. To enrich and triangulate our findings, we qualitatively analyze the
characteristics of multi-commit reviews and find that there are two types:
reviews of branches and revisions to single commits. We also examine the
reasons why commits on GitHub pull requests are rejected.

  Abstract = {
    The research community in Software Engineering and Software Testing in
    particular builds many of its contributions on a set of mutually shared
    expectations. These expectations often form the motivation for research on
    the creation of new testing tools and the refinement of existing test
    processes in an attempt to support practitioners. Despite the fact that they
    are the basis for many publications as well as open-source and commercial
    testing applications, the common expectations and beliefs are rarely ever
    questioned.  For example, Frederic Brooks' statement that testing takes half
    of the development time seems to have manifested itself within the community
    since he first made it in the ``Mythical Man Month'' in 1975. With this
    paper, we report on the surprising results of a large-scale field study with
    416 software engineers whose development activity we closely monitored over
    the course of five months, resulting in over 13 years of recorded work time.
    Our findings question several commonly shared assumptions and beliefs about
    testing and might be contributing factors to the observed bug proneness of
    software in practice: the majority of developers in our study does not test;
    developers rarely run their tests in the IDE; Test-driven Development is not
    widely practiced; and, last but not least, software developers only spend a
    quarter of their work time engineering tests, whereas they think they test
    half of their time.

  Abstract = {
    In the pull-based development model, the integrator has the crucial role of
    managing and integrating contributions. This work focuses on the role of
    the integrator and investigates working habits and challenges alike. We set
    up an exploratory qualitative study involving a large-scale survey of 749
    integrators, to which we add quantitative data from the integrator's
    project.  Our results provide insights into the factors they consider in
    their decision making process to accept or reject a contribution. Our key
    findings are that integrators struggle to maintain the quality of their
    projects and have difficulties with prioritizing contributions that are to
    be merged.  Our insights have implications for practitioners who wish to
    use or improve their pull-based development process, as well as for
    researchers striving to understand the theoretical implications of the
    pull-based model in software development.}

  Abstract = {
    This paper reports on a study mining the exception stack traces included in
    159,048 issues reported on Android projects hosted in GitHub (482 projects)
    and Google Code (157 projects). The goal of this study is to investigate
    whether stack trace information can reveal bug hazards related to exception
    handling code that may lead to a decrease in application robustness. Overall
    6,005 exception stack traces were extracted, and subjected to source code
    and bytecode analysis. The outcomes of this study include the identification
    of the following bug hazards: (i) unexpected cross-type exception wrappings
    (for instance, trying to handle an instance of OutOfMemoryError ``hidden''
    in a checked exception) which can make the exception-related code more
    complex and negatively impact the application robustness; (ii) undocumented
    runtime exceptions thrown by both the Android platform and third party
    libraries; and (iii) undoc- umented checked exceptions thrown by the Android
    Platform. Such undocumented exceptions make difficult, and most of the times
    infeasible for the client code to protect against unforeseen situations that
    may happen while calling third-party code. This study provides further
    insights on such bug hazards and the robustness threats they impose to
    Android apps as well as to other systems based on the Java exception model.

  A medium-sized west-European telecom company experienced a worsening trend in
  performance, indicating that the organization did not learn from history, in
  combination with much time and energy spent on preparation and review of
  project proposals. In order to create more transparency in the supplier
  proposal process a pilot was started on Functional Size Measurement pricing
  (FSM-pricing). In this paper, we evaluate the implementation of FSM-pricing
  in the software engineering domain of the company, as an instrument useful in
  the context of software man- agement and supplier proposal pricing. We found
  that a statistical, evidence-based pricing approach for software engineering,
  as a single instrument (without a connection with expert judgment), can be
  used in the subject companies to create cost transparency and performance
  management of software project portfolios.},

  Abstract = {
    After working for some time, developers commit their code changes to a
    version control system. When doing so, research shows that they often bundle
    unrelated changes (e.g., bug fix and refactoring) in a single commit, thus
    creating a so-called tangled commit. Sharing tangled commits is problematic
    because it makes review, reversion, and integration of these commits harder
    and historical analyses of the project less reliable.  Researchers have
    worked at untangling existing commits, i.e., finding which part of a commit
    relates to which task. In this paper, we contribute to this line of work in
    two ways: (1) A publicly available dataset of untangled code changes,
    created with the help of two developers who accurately split their code
    changes into self contained tasks over a period of four months; (2) based on
    this dataset we devise and assess EpiceaUntangler, an approach to help
    developers share untangled commits (aka. atomic commits) by using
    fine-grained code change information. We further evaluate EpiceaUntangler by
    deploying it to 7 developers, who used it for 2 weeks. We recorded a median
    success rate of 91\% and average one of 75\%, in automatically creating
    clusters of untangled fine-grained code changes.

  Abstract = {
    What do we know about software testing in the real world? It seems we know
    from Fred Brooks' seminal work ``The Mythical Man-Month'' that 50\% of
    project effort is spent on testing. However, due to the enormous advances in
    software engineering in the past 40 years, the question stands: Is this
    observation still true? In fact, was it ever true? The vision for our
    research is to settle the discussion about Brooks' estimation once and for
    all: How much do developers test? Does developers' estimation on how much
    they test match reality? How frequently do they execute their tests, and is
    there a relationship between test runtime and execution frequency? What are
    the typical reactions to failing tests? Do developers solve actual defects
    in the production code, or do they merely relax their test assertions?
    Emerging results from 40 software engineering students show that students
    overestimate their testing time threefold, and 50\% of them test as little
    as 4\% of their time, or less. Having proven the scalability of our
    infrastructure, we are now extending our case study with professional
    software engineers from open-source and industrial organizations.

    GitHub is a social coding platform that enables developers to efficiently

    employers and HR personnel who may use GitHub to learn more about a

    this process and automatically suggests matching job advertisements to
    developers, based on signals extracting from their activities on GitHub.

    PRioritizer. PRioritizer works like a priority inbox for pull requests,
    recommending the top pull requests the project owner should focus on. A
    preliminary user study showed that PRioritizer provides functionality that
    GitHub is currently lacking, even though users need more insight into how
    the priority ranking is established to make PRioritizer really useful.

    The rising number of MOOCs enable people to advance their knowledge and
    competencies in a wide range of fields. Learning though is only the first
    step, the transfer of the taught concepts into practice is equally important
    and often ne- glected in the investigation of MOOCs. In this paper, we
    consider the specific case of FP101x (a functional programming MOOC on
    EdX) and the extent to which learners alter their programming behaviour
    after having taken the course. We find the practical uptake six months after
    the course to be small: only ~3\% of learners that were not applying
    functional concepts in their programming practice before the start of
    FP101x, begin using them.
