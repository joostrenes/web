  ABSTRACT = {Invertible programming occurs in the area of data conversion where it is required that the conversion in one direction is the inverse of the other. For that purpose, we introduce bidirectional arrows (bi-arrows). The bi-arrow class is an extension of Haskell's arrow class with an extra combinator that changes the direction of computation. The advantage of the use of bi-arrows for invertible programming is the preservation of invertibility properties using the bi-arrow combinators. Programming with bi-arrows in a polytypic or generic way exploits this the most. Besides bidirectional polytypic examples, including invertible serialization, we give the definition of a monadic bi-arrow transformer, which we use to construct a bidirectional parser/pretty printer.}

  ABSTRACT = {
                   Generic/polytypic functional programming enables the compiler to
                   generate most of the code. This style of programming works
                   especially well for the generic textbook examples, but it generally
                   performs poorly for bigger programs. This paper uses generic
                   programming to derive a parser using a types-as-grammar approach,
                   circumventing the need for an external parser generator and allowing
                   the programmer to specify everything in the language of his choice.
                   We show just how much we can recover from the loss of performance
                   using an existing optimizer on several parser monads. The
                   types-as-grammar approach yields a rich (non-abstract) syntax tree,
                   and we explore the usability of generic programming for other syntax
                   tree operations in a (functional) compiler, such as type inference,
                   scope checking, and syntax transformations.}

  ABSTRACT = {Generic programming is accepted by the functional programming
                 community as a valuable tool for program development. Several
                 functional languages have adopted the generic scheme of type-indexed
                 values. This scheme works by specialization of a generic function to
                 a concrete type. However, the generated code is extremely
                 inefficient compared to its hand-written counterpart. The
                 performance penalty is so big that the practical usefulness of
                 generic programming is compromised. In this paper we present an
                 optimization algorithm that is able to completely eliminate the
                 overhead introduced by the specialization scheme for a large class
                 of generic functions. The presented technique is based on
                 consumer--producer elimination as exploited by fusion, a standard
                 general purpose optimization method. We show that our algorithm is
                 able to optimize many practical examples of generic functions.
                 Keywords: program transformation, fusion, generic/polytypic
                 programming.}
