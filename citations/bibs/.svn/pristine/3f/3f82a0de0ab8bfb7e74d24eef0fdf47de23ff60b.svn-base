% Policy
% ======
% - each group member inserts his/her own publications (for 2006)
%   in this file
% - only published papers are put here---no ``to appear's''---with
%   full bibliographic data (volume/page numbers etc.)
% - there is no uniform labeling or coding style required
% - uniformity for publications in the same journals/series (like
%   LNCS) is appreciated
% - if the publication *not* a refereed scientific publication,
%   please add a 'class="<value>"' field, where <value> is one
%   of the following:
%
%       Value    Meaning

  ABSTRACT = {
      This paper is both a position paper on a particular approach in program correctness, and also a
      contribution to this area. The approach entails the generation of programs (code) from the
      executable content of logical theories. This capability already exists within the main theorem
      provers like Coq, Isabelle and ACL2 and PVS. Here we will focus on issues portraying the use of
      this methodology, rather than the underlying theory. We illustrate the power of the approach within
      PVS via two case studies (on unification and compression) that lead to actual running code. We also
      demonstrate its flexibility by extending the program generation capabilities. This paper fits in a
      line of ongoing integration of programming and proving.}

  ABSTRACT = {
Bracket abstraction is an algorithm that transforms lambda
expressions into combinator terms. There are several versions of this algorithm
depending on the actual set of combinators that is used. Most
of them have been proven correct with respect to the operational semantics.
In this paper we focus on typability. We present a fully machine
verified proof of the property that bracket abstraction preserves types;
the types assigned to an expression before and after performing bracket
abstraction are identical. To our knowledge, this is the first time that
(1) such proof has been given, and (2) the proof is verified by a theorem
prover. The theorem prover used in the development of the proof is PVS.}
