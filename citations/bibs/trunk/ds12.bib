% Policy
% ======
% - each group member inserts his/her own publications (for 2012)
%   in this file
% - please use 'and' between ALL authors; not only between the last two!
% - only published papers are put here---no ``to appear's''---with
%   full bibliographic data (volume/page numbers etc.)
% - there is no uniform labeling or coding style required
% - uniformity for publications in the same journals/series (like
%   LNCS) is appreciated
% - if the publication *not* a refereed scientific publication,
%   please add a 'class="<value>"' field, where <value> is one
%   of the following:
%
%       Value    Meaning
%       -----    -------
%       Abs      Abstract
%       Ann      Annotation
%       Ext pre  Dissertation external preprint
%       Int      Dissertation internal
%       Int pre  Dissertation internal preprint
%       Ext      Dissertation external
%       Pat      Patent
%       Oth      Other result of scientific activities
%       Pop      Popular publication (intended for advanced layman)
%       Vak      A publication written to spread knowledge
%       Wet      A scientific publication refereed
%       Wet non  A scientific publication non-refereed
