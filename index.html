I am a Crypto & Security architect at NXP Semiconductors in Eindhoven, the Netherlands.
</p>

<p>
Before that I was a postdoctoral researcher in the Digital Security group at Radboud University in the Netherlands. There I also obtained my PhD with Prof. Lejla Batina with my thesis titled 
<a href="publications/thesis.pdf">
    <i>Security on the Line: Modern Curve-based Cryptography</i></a>. 
During the summers of 2016, 2017 and 2018 I was an intern in the Security and Cryptography group at Microsoft Research in Redmond.
I completed Part III of the Mathematical Tripos at the University of Cambridge after receiving my BSc in Mathematics at Utrecht University.

My interests mainly lie in the topic of cryptographic primitives,
especially elliptic curves and their arithmetic.
Recently my focus has been more generally on post-quantum cryptographic
primitives:
I am one of the developers of the isogeny-based NIST proposal SIKE.
I also have a strong interest
in implementations
on resource-constrained devices
and the impact of post-quantum crypto on embedded systems.
