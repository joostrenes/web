I am a Sr. Cryptographer at NXP Semiconductors based in Eindhoven, the Netherlands.
I work towards enabling post-quantum cryptography (PQC) for various applications, mostly
in the embedded domain.
This involves taking on the many challenges that post-quantum algorithms bring
such as high memory consumption and run-times and immature understanding of
security against side-channel analysis and fault attacks.
I am also excited to integrate PQC in real-world applications, 
for example in the automotive and (industrial) IoT domains.

Before my time at NXP I was a postdoctoral researcher in the Digital Security group at Radboud University in the Netherlands. There I also obtained my PhD with Prof. Lejla Batina with my thesis titled 
<a href="publications/thesis.pdf">
    <i>Security on the Line: Modern Curve-based Cryptography</i></a>. 
During the summers of 2016, 2017 and 2018 I was an intern in the Security and Cryptography group at Microsoft Research in Redmond.
I completed Part III of the Mathematical Tripos at the University of Cambridge after receiving my BSc in Mathematics at Utrecht University.
