<p>
I am a Senior Crypto & Security architect at NXP Semiconductors in Eindhoven, the Netherlands.
</p>

<p>
Before that I was a postdoctoral researcher in the Digital Security group at Radboud University in the Netherlands. There I also obtained my PhD with Prof. Lejla Batina with my thesis titled 
<a href="publications/thesis.pdf">
    <i>Security on the Line: Modern Curve-based Cryptography</i></a>. 
During the summers of 2016, 2017 and 2018 I was an intern in the Security and Cryptography group at Microsoft Research in Redmond.
I completed Part III of the Mathematical Tripos at the University of Cambridge after receiving my BSc in Mathematics at Utrecht University.

I have a strong interest in developing cryptographic primitives
and protocols.
In particular I enjoy working on elliptic curves, both classically as well
as in post-quantum settings,
and
I am one of the developers of the isogeny-based NIST proposal SIKE.
My current focus is more generally on enabling post-quantum secure
cryptography on resource-constrained systems
to allow for timely migration under the looming quantum threat.
